 > This project functions as the formal modeling and specification for an online exchange system for complex goods designed using the Vienna Development Method (VDM).

> It represents an online exchange system where users place orders by referring a product and describing their attributes, and then attempt to trade them. Each order is composed of a product, type (buying or selling) and list of attributes. The system is responsible for creating matches accordingly.
