- Order
	- Buy/Sell
	- List of properties wanted for a SINGLE item
	- Properties: list of values/options, range or boolean
	- Order size?
	- Later on: order composed of a union of several items, each with different properties
	- Later on: filter function (example: I DON'T want a specific property, like the color red)
	
- Central System
	- Structure for index orders
	- Unordered list for non-index orders
	- Functionalities: add, modify and cancel order

- New Order
	- Index order
		- List of properties for a given item
		- Organized in a tree-like graph (where each layer = different property) for fast lookups/retrieval
		- Need to analyse best possible structure?
	- Non-index order
		- Simply an item
		
- Central System Logic:
	- New order
		- for each incoming new order
			- try matching with index orders structure
			- if no matches
				- if index order add to index orders structure
				- if non-index order add to unordered list of non-index orders
		- after all new orders have been handled
			- for each non-index order
				- try matching with indexed orders structure
	
	- Modify order
		- check for new matches
		- should check for unnecessary cases
		- example: seller raises price; if there were no matches before, there won't be any matches now
	
	- Cancel order
		- simply remove the order from the system
		
- Notes
	- Central System could be made of only two structures (index and non-index orders)
	- Add a different field, type (either Buy or Sell), to each order
	- Avoids duplicate structures by only checking type-field when looping index orders list
